# DEDA Course - Group 3 Homework: Capturing the Baijiu(白酒) Industry Landscape

This repository contains the Python code developed for our group project in the DEDA course.  The project focuses on analyzing the stock prices of Baijiu industry public firms, incorporating various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

Our project encompasses several key aspects:

* **Word Cloud Generation:**  We create word clouds from a list of Tang Dynasty poems and a provided Baijiu industry report.
* **Topic Modeling of Industry Reports:** We utilize Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify key themes and topics within the Baijiu industry report.
* **Baijiu Stock Price Analysis:** We import historical stock price data for publicly listed Baijiu companies. We then analyze price trends using dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP and minimum spanning trees (MST).
* **Stock Price Prediction:** We employ machine learning models, including XGBoost and SVM, to predict future stock prices based on the analyzed data.
